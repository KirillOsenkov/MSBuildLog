    <h2 id="usingdotnet">dotnet build -bl</h2>
    <p>You can produce binary logs from the <span class="inlineCode">dotnet build</span> command by passing the <span class="inlineCode">-bl</span> argument:</p>
    <div class="code">dotnet build -bl</div>

    <h2 id="MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE">Using MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE=1 to get full binlogs from Visual Studio</h2>
    <p>There are known limitations in binlogs obtained via the Project System Tools. Instead, try setting the MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE=1 environment variable as described <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/e868d91a40fb59cd258844a8d31114c1c3fabf2a/documentation/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-Full-Framework-MSBuild.md#logs" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="replay">Replaying a .binlog to reconstruct text logs</h2>
    <p>You can pass a <span class="inlineCode">.binlog</span> file to MSBuild instead of a project/solution to replay it to other loggers, as if a real build was happening. This allows you to reconstruct a text log of any verbosity given the <span class="inlineCode">.binlog</span> file. Read more at: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md#replaying-a-binary-log">https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Binary-Log#replaying-a-binary-log</a></p>

    <h2 id="advantages">Binary log advantages</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="accent">Completeness</span> - records the exact events in order they happened during the build. You can replay a binary log into other loggers to reconstruct full text logs. Pass the <span class="inlineCode">.binlog</span> file to MSBuild.exe instead of a project/solution to replay the log as if the original build was happening.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Verbosity</span> - binary logs capture more information than even the most diagnostic-level text logs. The binary logger turns on various MSBuild switches to output more information, such as task inputs and target outputs.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Faster builds</span> - less overhead than a text log, can make builds significantly faster if other logs are disabled. They can be reconstructed later anyway if needed.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Smaller disk size</span> - a binary log is much smaller in size than a corresponding diagnostic-level text log (10-20x or more). This can result in significant storage savings on CI servers.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Easier to read/analyze</span> - text logs (especially from multi-processor builds) can become unwieldy, intertwined and hard to read. The viewer allows to collapse unneeded sections, as well as intelligent search.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Programmatic access</span> - All information is easily accessible programmatically for tools such as analyzers (whereas you need to parse text logs yourself and it's hard without a clearly defined structure) A <a href="#api">.NET API</a> is available to load and query binary logs.</li>
            <li><span class="accent">Embedded source files</span> - optionally embed the source text of all project files and imported targets files used during the build, so it is possible to correlate log events with the source code. Preprocessed view (with all imports inlined) is available for each file (like <span class="inlineCode">/pp</span>).</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="features">Viewer Features</h2>
    <p>The MSBuild Structured Log Viewer can build projects and solutions or open existing log files:</p>
    <img src="Screenshot2.png" width="70%" />
    <p>Leverage the source code of projects and targets embedded in the log file:</p>
    <img src="ViewerOverview3.gif" width="100%" />

    <p>The viewer supports two file formats:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="inlineCode">*.binlog</span> (official MSBuild binary log format, produced by <span class="inlineCode">msbuild.exe /bl</span></li>
        <li><span class="inlineCode">*.xml</span> (for large human-readable XML logs)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The viewer can read all formats and can save to <span class="inlineCode">*.xml</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="redaction">Sensitive data redaction</h2>
    <p>
        Binlog is containing rich troubleshooting information, which can as well include some of the data, that users might not want to share with others (environment variables, local paths, secrets passed to tasks etc.)
        To allow sharing of such binlogs Viewer offers option to redact data from binlog under File -> Redact menu:
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshot-redact.png" width="100%" />
    <p>
        Note that the autodetection option is currently supporting only a very limited number of patterns (and even after future extensions it can only be considered best-efforts redaction - not an exhaustive one). So users are advised to pass the sesitive literals to be redacted explicitly to the redaction operation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="commandline">Command-line help for the /bl switch</h2>
    <p>See MSBuild command-line help <span class="inlineCode">msbuild /?</span> for more information on the <span class="inlineCode">/bl</span> switch. The switch is available starting with MSBuild 15.3 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer).</p>
    <div class="code">
        /binaryLogger[:[LogFile=]output.binlog[;ProjectImports={None,Embed,ZipFile}]]
        Serializes all build events to a compressed binary file.
        By default the file is in the current directory and named
        "msbuild.binlog". The binary log is a detailed description
        of the build process that can later be used to reconstruct
        text logs and used by other analysis tools. A binary log
        is usually 10-20x smaller than the most detailed text
        diagnostic-level log, but it contains more information.
        (Short form: /bl)

        The binary logger by default collects the source text of
        project files, including all imported projects and target
        files encountered during the build. The optional
        ProjectImports switch controls this behavior:

        ProjectImports=None     - Don't collect the project
        imports.
        ProjectImports=Embed    - Embed project imports in the
        log file.
        ProjectImports=ZipFile  - Save project files to
        output.projectimports.zip
        where output is the same name
        as the binary log file name.

        The default setting for ProjectImports is Embed.
        Note: the logger does not collect non-MSBuild source files
        such as .cs, .cpp etc.

        A .binlog file can be "played back" by passing it to
        msbuild.exe as an argument instead of a project/solution.
        Other loggers will receive the information contained
        in the log file as if the original build was happening.
        You can read more about the binary log and its usages at:
        https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog

        Examples:
        /bl
        /bl:output.binlog
        /bl:output.binlog;ProjectImports=None
        /bl:output.binlog;ProjectImports=ZipFile
        /bl:..\..\custom.binlog
        /binaryLogger
    </div>

    <h2 id="olderVersions">Recording a binary log with older versions of MSBuild</h2>
    <p>The built-in <span class="inlineCode">/bl</span> switch was only introduced in MSBuild 15.3 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3). However there is a way to record a binary log with previous versions of MSBuild as well. You can attach the logger to any MSBuild-based build using the logger library targeting MSBuild 14: <span class="inlineCode">StructuredLogger.dll</span>. It is available in a NuGet package:</p>
    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSBuild.StructuredLogger.net45" target="_blank">MSBuild.StructuredLogger.net45</a>
    <p>Or you could download it directly here: <a download href="https://msbuildlog.com/net45/StructuredLogger.dll">https://msbuildlog.com/net45/StructuredLogger.dll</a></p>
    <p>Use a command-line such as this to pass the <span class="inlineCode">BinaryLogger</span> to MSBuild:</p>
    <div class="code">msbuild solution.sln /t:Rebuild /v:diag /noconlog /logger:BinaryLogger,StructuredLogger.dll;1.binlog</div>

    <h2 id="ide">Investigating IDE and design-time builds inside Visual Studio</h2>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProjectSystemTools" target="_blank">Project System Tools</a> Visual Studio extension to record binary logs of IDE and design-time builds.</p>
    <p>See more information about design-time builds here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/master/docs/design-time-builds.md">https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/master/docs/design-time-builds.md</a></p>

    <h2 id="security">Security Warning</h2>
    <p>The binary log contains and exposes all environment variables from the machine that the build ran on. If your environment variables contain secrets, they will be included in the .binlog file in plaintext.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the source code of all project (.csproj) and targets files (.props, .targets, etc) is embedded in the .binlog file as well.</p>
    <p>Some details from the file system (such as the name of the users folder) are visible as well.</p>
    <p>However other source code (such as C# files) and files not related to the build are not included.</p>
    <p>Before sharing binary log files please review the binary log file using the viewer to make sure there are no environment variables that should be kept private. Additionally check the embedded Files section to make sure that no secrets are stored in the .csproj files.</p>
    <p>It is extremely important to be aware of these risks and it is recommended to treat the .binlog files like you treat your source code.</p>

    <h2 id="api">Reading MSBuild .binlogs programmatically</h2>

    <p>Reference the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSBuild.StructuredLogger" target="_blank">MSBuild.StructuredLogger</a> NuGet package. All you need is to reference StructuredLogger.dll from that package.</p>
    <p>You may also need to reference MSBuild <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Framework" target="_blank">Microsoft.Build.Framework</a>.</p>
    <p>There are various APIs for various scenarios. A high-level API to read a .binlog file into a tree structure that you normally see in the viewer is:</p>
    <div class="code">
        using System;
        using Microsoft.Build.Logging.StructuredLogger;

        class BinaryLogReadBuild
        {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        string binLogFilePath = @"C:\temp\test.binlog";

        var buildRoot = BinaryLog.ReadBuild(binLogFilePath);
        buildRoot.VisitAllChildren&lt;CscTask&gt;(c => Console.WriteLine(c.CommandLineArguments));
        }
        }
    </div>
    <p>There is a more formal API to read the C# compiler invocations from a binlog, read more here:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/wiki/Reading-Compiler-invocations" target="_blank">https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/wiki/Reading-Compiler-invocations</a>
    <p>If you need a lower-level API to read the raw .binlog records yourself you can use <span class="inlineCode">BinLogReader.ReadRecords(string binLogFilePath)</span>:</p>
    <div class="code">
        using System;
        using Microsoft.Build.Framework;
        using Microsoft.Build.Logging;
        using Microsoft.Build.Logging.StructuredLogger;

        class BinLogReader
        {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        string binLogFilePath = @"C:\temp\test.binlog";

        var binLogReader = new BinLogReader();
        foreach (var record in binLogReader.ReadRecords(binLogFilePath))
        {
        var buildEventArgs = record.Args;

        // print command lines of all tool tasks such as Csc
        if (buildEventArgs is TaskCommandLineEventArgs taskCommandLine)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(taskCommandLine.CommandLine);
        }
        }
        }
        }
    </div>
    <p>Another example of using the API is reading start/end times and durations of targets:</p>
